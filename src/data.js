          "content":'Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency for online payments between two parties in a decentralized manner and without an intermediary.\n Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology and exhibits characteristics of money but it is unlike conventional cash. \nFor example, just like cash, it is a bearer instrument, meaning the person who has keys to an online wallet containing Bitcoin, owns the coins. It is also fungible./nThis means that one Bitcoin is equivalent in value to another Bitcoin, making it possible to use them for trading. But transactions that utilize Bitcoin are not anonymous. \nPublicly-available ledgers on blockchain, Bitcoin underlying technology, ensure that anyone can see the transfers and withdrawals taking place in the cryptocurrency network. In contrast, cash-based transactions are anonymous.\nA rapid appreciation in price and limited availability has converted Bitcoin into a store of value for investors. In this role, it acts in a fashion similar to gold. Only 21 million Bitcoin will ever exist and the rate at which they are being mined is a decreasing curve. \nThe resulting rarity translates to significant and increasing monetary value being attached to each Bitcoin in existence. For example, consider that Bitcoin price had recorded an appreciation of 9,000,000 percent since inception, as of last December.'
