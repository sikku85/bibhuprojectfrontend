                According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt. Ltd.
                (CMIE), the unemployment rate in India increased from 6.5% in
                November 2020 to 7.75% in October 2021. In this fluctuating
                market, there has been an increase in the demand for the
                stability and permanence offered by a Sarkari Naukri.
